# Seismic_Damage_Classifier
This is a part of the research project I have been working with. Project aimed to build effective machine learning classification algorithms for seismic damage assessemnt of buildings. A random forest model have been developed in the initial stage. Data cleaning and preprocessing have also been done. A complete machine learning model has developed.
